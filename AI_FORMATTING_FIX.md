# AI Formatting Fix - Clean Tool Output Processing

## Problems Fixed

### Problem 1: Ugly Raw Tool Output
The AI was showing raw, unformatted tool results directly to users:

```
For the most current information about "where investors missing opportunities contrarian October 2025 markets sectors panic opportunity 'investors missing opportunities' 'panic' 'October 2025'", I recommend checking recent financial news sources, company investor relations pages, or financial data platforms.I'll pull up current fear-driven opportunities and then sum them up in plain, concise bullets. {"query":"contrarian investment opportunities 2025 market fear panic beaten down sectors opportunities"} Here's what the latest chatter says: often fear hits sectors like...
```

**Issues:**
- ‚ùå Exposed raw query strings and JSON
- ‚ùå No markdown formatting
- ‚ùå Showed technical placeholders
- ‚ùå Verbose, not Nordic style
- ‚ùå No structure (bullets, bold, etc.)

### Problem 2: Inconsistent Formatting
Tool results weren't being processed through the Nordic style filter.

## Solution

Updated system prompts in both API routes to explicitly instruct the AI to:
1. **Never show raw output**
2. **Always rewrite in Nordic style**
3. **Use markdown formatting**
4. **Filter technical placeholders**

### Files Updated

#### 1. `/src/app/api/chat/stream/route.ts`
#### 2. `/src/app/api/chat/route.ts`

### Added Instructions

```typescript
**CRITICAL - Processing Tool Results:**
When you receive tool results, YOU MUST:
1. NEVER show raw tool output directly to users
2. ALWAYS rewrite in Nordic style (short, playful, 2-4 bullets)
3. Filter out technical placeholders like "Not finding data on that"
4. Extract key insights and present them cleanly
5. Use markdown formatting: **bold**, bullets, line breaks
6. If tool returns placeholder, ask user for more specifics
```

### Updated Rules

Added to existing rules:
```typescript
**Rules:**
...
6. NEVER show raw JSON, query strings, or technical output
```

### Enhanced Formatting Guidelines

```typescript
**Formatting:**
- Use markdown with **bold** for emphasis
- Use emojis sparingly (1-2 per response)
- No em dashes (‚Äî)
- Line breaks between ideas
- Bullet points for lists  ‚Üê NEW
```

## How It Works

### Before (Raw Output):
```
For the most current information about "where investors missing opportunities contrarian October 2025 markets sectors panic opportunity 'investors missing opportunities' 'panic' 'October 2025'", I recommend checking recent financial news sources...{"query":"contrarian investment opportunities 2025 market fear panic beaten down sectors opportunities"}
```

### After (Nordic Formatted):
```
**Where's the fear hiding opportunities?**

Right now, investors are overlooking:
- **Energy** - Temporary headline panic
- **Quality tech** - Sold off on short-term noise
- **Distressed debt** - Cash-rich companies on sale

The pattern? Fear is driving prices, but fundamentals stay strong.

### 3. **Smart Filtering**

## AI Behavior Changes

### Tool Result Processing

**Old Behavior:**
```
AI receives: "Not finding data on that. Try a specific ticker or topic?"
AI outputs: "Not finding data on that. Try a specific ticker or topic?"
```

**New Behavior:**
```
AI receives: "Not finding data on that. Try a specific ticker or topic?"
AI outputs: "Couldn't find info on that. Got a specific ticker in mind? üéØ"
```

### Markdown Usage

**Old:**
```
often fear hits sectors like energy, quality tech driven by temporary headlines, distressed debt, cash-rich balance sheets with buybacks, and commodity markets when supply fears spike.
```

**New:**
```
**Fear-driven opportunities:**

- **Energy** - Temporary panic
- **Tech** - Headline-driven selloffs
- **Distressed debt** - Quality on sale
- **Commodities** - Supply fear spikes

Each one? Short-term fear, long-term potential.
```

## Testing Examples

### Test 1: General Market Query

**User:** "Where are investors missing opportunities?"

**Expected Response:**
```
**Current fear = opportunity zones:**

- **Energy stocks** - Short-term panic, solid fundamentals
- **Quality tech** - Oversold on temporary news
- **Distressed debt** - Patient capital can win here

The crowd's scared. That's when Snobol looks closer.

Want specifics on any sector?
```

### Test 2: With Placeholder

**User:** "Tell me about XYZ"

**Old (Bad):**
```
Not finding data on that. Try a specific ticker or topic?
```

**New (Good):**
```
Couldn't find anything on XYZ. 

Is it a stock ticker? Or maybe you meant something else? Drop me a valid ticker and I'll dig in. üîç
```

### Test 3: Analysis Response

**User:** "Analyze AAPL"

**Expected (Clean, Formatted):**
```
**AAPL - Quick Take**

Apple makes iPhones, services, wearables. Massive ecosystem.

**Money:** Market cap $2.8T | Profit margin 25.3% | Revenue $383B

**Watch:** Beta 1.24 (above-average volatility) | P/E 29.4

[Chart appears above]
```

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Professional presentation** - No raw technical output  
‚úÖ **Consistent Nordic style** - All responses match philosophy  
‚úÖ **Better readability** - Markdown formatting with structure  
‚úÖ **User-friendly** - Filters technical placeholders  
‚úÖ **Engaging** - Playful tone maintained throughout  

## Technical Details

### System Prompt Location

1. **Streaming API:** `/src/app/api/chat/stream/route.ts` (lines 59-66)
2. **Regular API:** `/src/app/api/chat/route.ts` (lines 59-66)

### What Changed

**Added:**
- Explicit instructions to never show raw output
- Requirement to rewrite in Nordic style
- Markdown formatting mandate
- Placeholder filtering rules
- New rule #6: No raw JSON/query strings

**Result:**
- AI now processes all tool results before displaying
- Extracts insights and formats cleanly
- Maintains Nordic style consistently
- Uses rich text markdown throughout

## Edge Cases Handled

| Scenario | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Empty tool result | Shows placeholder | Asks for clarification (Nordic) |
| Long text output | Wall of text | Formatted bullets |
| JSON in output | Visible JSON | Hidden, parsed, presented cleanly |
| Query strings | Exposed | Filtered out |
| Technical terms | Shown raw | Simplified or explained |

## Validation

To verify the fix works:

1. **Ask general question:** "Where are opportunities?"
   - ‚úÖ Should see formatted bullets, not raw text
   
2. **Ask about invalid ticker:** "Show me XYZ"
   - ‚úÖ Should see playful Nordic-style prompt, not "Not finding data..."
   
3. **Request analysis:** "Analyze AAPL"
   - ‚úÖ Should see **bold**, bullets, clean structure
   
4. **Check for raw JSON:** Look for `{"query":...}` patterns
   - ‚úÖ Should NEVER appear in responses

## Notes

- This fix is prompt-based (no code changes to executors needed)
- AI now has explicit instructions to process tool output
- Works for all tool types: search_web, get_stock_quote, analyze_company, show_stock_chart
- Maintains contrarian, opportunistic philosophy
- Ensures playful, wholesome, Nordic tone throughout
