## Benefits of Brave Search

| Feature | Before (DuckDuckGo) | After (Brave Search) |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Data Quality | ⚠️ Minimal/Abstract only | ✅ Rich snippets + infoboxes |
| Financial Data | ❌ Very limited | ✅ Enhanced |
| Structured Data | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (Wikipedia-style infoboxes) |
| Privacy | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Rate Limits | ✅ None | ⚠️ 2,000/month free |
| Authentication | ✅ None needed | ⚠️ API key required |

## API Usage Estimation

**Conservative estimate:**
- 1 stock analysis = ~3 API calls (overview + financials + risks)
- 2,000 queries/month ÷ 3 = **~650 stock analyses per month**
- Daily average: **~21 analyses per day**

This is sufficient for typical chatbot usage.

## Graceful Degradation

If API key is missing or API fails:
- ✅ System falls back to placeholder responses
- ✅ Users still see helpful guidance
- ✅ Source links still provided
- ✅ TradingView charts still render
- ⚠️ Warning logged in console

## Testing

To test without API key:
1. Don't set `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
2. System will use placeholder responses
3. Check console for warning: `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY not configured`

To test with API key:
1. Set `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
2. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Ask: "Analyze Apple stock"
4. Should see rich, detailed responses

## Next Steps

1. **Get API Key**: Visit https://api.search.brave.com/register
2. **Add to Environment**: Create `.env.local` with your API key
3. **Restart Server**: `npm run dev`
4. **Test**: Try "Analyze AAPL stock" or "Show TSLA chart"
5. **Monitor Usage**: Check dashboard at https://api.search.brave.com/app/dashboard

## Rollback (if needed)

If you need to revert to DuckDuckGo:
1. Revert changes in `src/lib/functionExecutors.ts`
2. Remove `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` from environment
3. Restart server

However, DuckDuckGo provides inferior results, so this is not recommended.
